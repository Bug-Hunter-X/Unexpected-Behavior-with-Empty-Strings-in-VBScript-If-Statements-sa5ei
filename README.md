This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript related to how it handles empty strings in conditional statements.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from VBScript's loose typing and how it implicitly converts values during comparisons.  While seemingly simple, this can lead to logic errors that are difficult to track down.
